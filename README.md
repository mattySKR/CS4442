Artificial Intelligence II

=== COURSE DESCRIPTION ===

A broad range of areas falls into the field of Artificial Intelligence. We go through
a brief introduction to two very active areas of Artificial Intelligence: machine learning 
and deep learning with applications in computer vision. We study both algorithmic perspectives
of artificial intelligence and their practical applications in computer vision.

=== SOME TOPICS ===

* Linear Regression
* Regularization
* Logistic Regression
* Generative Models
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Kernels
* Prinicipal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Edge Detection
* Segmentation
* Motion
* Deep Neural Network (DNN)
* Back Propagation
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
