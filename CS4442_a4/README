--- CIFAR 10 classification: ---

  The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images
  per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into
  five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. We consider 4 training batches
  as training set (40000 images), 1 training batch (10000 images) as validation.

Part a) 

  We downloaded the dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Part b) 

  We used Pytorch deep learning framework and the AlexNet pretrained model, to classify the images 
  in the CIFAR10 dataset. We then constructed a confusion matrix that relates the CIFAR10 classes with 
  the 10 most frequent classes from ImageNet predicted by the model.
  
Part c) 

  Here, we used Pytorch deep learning framework and the AlexNet pretrained model to extract features for 
  all the images in the CIFAR10 dataset. We then used the output of the ’fc6’ layer. We trained a linear 
  classifier (logistic regression or linear svm) and evaluated it, using the train, validation and test 
  partitions suggested for the dataset.
  
  
Part d) 

  We repeated the previous step, but this time using as features the output of the ’fc7’ layer.
  We then compared and discussed the results.
