=== COURSE DESCRIPTION ===

A broad range of areas falls into the field of Artificial Intelligence. We go through
a brief introduction to two very active areas of Artificial Intelligence: machine learning 
and deep learning with applications in computer vision. We study both algorithmic perspectives
of artificial intelligence and their practical applications in computer vision.
