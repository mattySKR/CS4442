--- Part 1: (Separable Convolution) ---

    Separable Convolution refers to breaking down the convolution kernel into lower dimension kernels.
    We show that convolution with a 2D Gaussian kernel is a spatially separable convolution, i.e. there are two
    1D kernels if applied to the image row-wise and column-wise in sequence, it is equivalent to convolving
    that image with the 2D Gaussian kernel. We discuss whether Sobel kernel spatially separable.
    We then discuss why separable convolutions are preferred.
    

--- Part 2: (Edge Detection) ---

    Here, we implemented Canny Edge Detection algorithm in "canny_eedge_class.py" and "canny_edge_test.py". 
    We applied our program to detect edges in image 1. Our program takes as an input a grayscale image, the 
    sigma of the Gaussian filter and the two low and high thresholds. The output of our program is a binary 
    image. We implemented gaussian convolution as a separable sequence of horizontal and vertical convolutions.
    
    
--- Part 3: (Corner Detection) ---

    Here, we implemented Harris Corner Detection algorithm. We applied our program to detect
    corners in image 1.
    
    
* Any image in the /CS4442_a3 directory can be used for testing or any other preferred grayscale image. *
