    Quesion 1 involves Laplace smoothing  and Question 2 involves constructing
    new kernels by combining the existing kernels. ***
    
    
--- For Question 3: ---
For this part, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze face images in Python. 
The data set located in faces.dat.txt.zip; each row represents animage (400 images), and each 
column represents a pixel (64 Ã— 64 = 4096 pixels).

a) 3_a.py

In this program we just display the 100th image.


b) 3_b.py

In this program we remove the mean of the images, and then display the 100th image.


c)
